Improvements

- Token repository only validates on first [0] token in DB so multiple user tokens cant be supported as of now

- count of stock based on category is coming wrong

- If category id is wrong it gives 400 Bad request, instead it should say invalid ID. 400 error code indicates that the server was unable to process the request sent by the client due to invalid syntax but in this case the syntax of request is fine but the parameter is invalid. the error handling here is wrong

- category POST request is entering autogenerated id instead of the one passed in the POST request

- Category POST request expects the ID to be system.Guid type then it should be specified in the Swagger, as its a external API  in swagger which could be exposed if needed for integration. else ID should be of type nvarchar or not asked for at all.

- Category PUT gives option to edit ID and CategoryName but ID is a Primary key so if we pass ID anything different than whats in DB it throws 500 error. This should had been handled properly or shouldnt had been an option in the API at all.

- Category Delete , If a proper system.guid is passed which is non existent in the DB then 500 is thrown instead of handling it properly.

- Overall there is no way to update the product count in the website as even the POST api adds the category but doesnt update the stock even when provided in the request body

- there is ambiguity in the terminologies, Product and stock, at different places its called differently

- in categories page the product count is not reflected correctly  as per DB.

- If we execute any api before login into website it throw 400, why show any option at all to a non authorised user other than login, this exposes the structure of our API's?



UI Test (Protractor)
- before login Categories page is missing and Login page is shown with token option, successfull login, logout link is shown and categories page is shown
- login using incorrect token shows proper error message
- before login Categories link in home page navigate to Login page and after login Categories link in home page navigate to Categories page
- before login API link in home page navigate to API page but API's dont work , after login API's call work
- LinnworksTest navigates to Home page
- post logout, categories page is not visible and API's dont work 


Backend Api Unit Test Cases to cover- (NUnit )
- Auth wrong token
- PUT Stock with category
- category Get id correct
- Category Put correct ID and update Name
- Category delete existing Category, check null pointer


FrontEnd Unit test (Jasmine)
- verify login duration takes less than 10 secs
- verify that login causes the categories page class to be loaded
- verify that clickin gon "create New" navigates to "add-category" page
- verify in property of HTML that the login button is disabled when the page is launched

MSSQL integration test (TBD)
- insert method for categories
- delete method for categories
- method to update stock of categories
- method to update name of categories
- method to get all the details from MSSQL
